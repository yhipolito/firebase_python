# Overview

I am trying to master firebase integration with python on a python program.

This program is called helipads information and it interacts with cloud database. You have 5 options on this program, the 4 first ones will allow you to perform CRUD operations with Cloud Databases; The last option is just to quit the program.

My purpose to write this software is to keep track of Helipad information like name, location (in coordinates) and elevation. These data is very important for helicopter pilots to perform their work on several helipads on their operational area.

# Cloud Database

I used firebase from Google

I have created a database for helipads with their fields for name, location and elevation.

# Development Environment

I used firebase_admin module which I have install with pip3
then I used Python, firebase from Google and visual studio code as Text editor

I used Python 3.10 and firebase_admin module
